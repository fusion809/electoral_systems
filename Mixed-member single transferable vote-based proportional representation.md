Mixed-member single transferable vote-based proportional representation (MMSTVPR) is a variant on mixed-member proportional representation (MMPR). 

In MMPR, voters get two, maybe three, votes: 

1. for a candidate to represent them their single-member electorate;
2. for their preferred party (party list vote); and
3. for their preferred candidate among those running via the party list for their preferred party.

Members elected by (1) are elected first, and then the second vote is used to elect additional members to proportion things out, such that the percentage of votes a given party receives in (2) is approximately equal to the percentage of seats in the chamber they are allocated. (3) is used to determine which individual candidates occupy the seats the party wins based on the party list vote. Not all MMPR systems allow for voters to choose who occupies seats allocated to parties based on the party list vote, in fact it is the norm for these systems not to.

In MMSTVPR, voters also get two or three votes:

1. for a candidate to represent their multi-member electorate, with these members elected using single transferable vote (STV);
2. for their preferred party (party list vote); and
3. for the candidates they most want to occupy the seats their preferred party won based on their share of the party list vote.

Like with MMPR, those elected using (1) are elected first, and then the second vote is used to elect additional members to proportion things out. (3) is used to decide, by STV, who occupies the seats the parties have won based on their share of the party list vote. 

Because STV from multi-member electorates provides semi-proportional representation alfready, the percentage of members that need to be elected by (2) is relatively small compared to when a traditional MMPR system is used.
